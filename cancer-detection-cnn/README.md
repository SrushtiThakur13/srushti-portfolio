# Automated Cancer Detection (CNN)

Deep learning pipeline for automated cancer detection from medical images, designed to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## 🚀 Key Achievement
- Achieved **95% accuracy** on test images.  
- Applied **data augmentation** to handle class imbalance and improve robustness.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Data Augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling)  
- Medical Imaging  

## 📂 Future Plans
- Expand dataset with open-source medical images.  
- Compare CNN with transformer-based vision models.
