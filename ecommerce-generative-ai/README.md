# E-Commerce Generative AI

Fine-tuned Falcon 7B LLM to power an intelligent Q&A system for e-commerce, optimized for GPU memory and deployed in production.

## 🚀 Key Achievement
- Optimized GPU memory usage by **50%+** using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization.  
- Deployed pipeline on Kubernetes with Docker, integrated into Google Cloud Platform.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Falcon 7B  
- QLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)  
- Tesla T4 GPU  
- Kubernetes + Docker  
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)  
- 4-bit Quantization  

## 📂 Future Plans
- Add retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with FAISS.  
- Connect pipeline to real e-commerce datasets.
